# Business Site

Replace this readme with your own information about the project. You can include things like:

- Make a business site with a sign up form and a background picture or video. The form should inlude radio button, check box, select and a submit button.
- The data from the form should be posted into a service called HTTPBin.
- I set up the form and positioned the viedo behind
- I would work more on the responsiveness if I had more time.
