# Business Site

Replace this readme with your own information about the project. You can include things like:

- Make a business site with a sign up form and a background picture or video. The form should inlude radio button, check box, select and a submit button.
- The data from the form should be posted into a service called HTTPBin.
- I set up the form and positioned the viedo behind
- I would work more on the responsiveness if I had more time.

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
